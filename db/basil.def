description: Basil (/ˈbæzəl/, BAZ-əl;[1] US also /ˈbeɪzəl/, BAY-zəl;[2] Ocimum basilicum (/ˈɒsɪməm bəˈzɪlɪkəm/, OS-ih-məm bə-ZIL-ih-kəm)[3][4]), also called great basil, is a culinary herb of the family Lamiaceae (mints). It is a tender plant, and is used in cuisines worldwide. In Western cuisine, the generic term "basil" refers to the variety also known as Genovese basil or sweet basil. Basil is native to tropical regions from Central Africa to Southeast Asia.[5] In temperate climates basil is treated as an annual plant, but it can be grown as a short-lived perennial or biennial in warmer horticultural zones with tropical or Mediterranean climates.[5] There are many varieties of basil including sweet basil, Thai basil (O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora), and Mrs. Burns' Lemon (O. basilicum var. citriodora). O. basilicum can cross-pollinate with other species of the Ocimum genus, producing hybrids such as lemon basil (O. × citriodorum) and African blue basil (O. × kilimandscharicum).\n##Description\nTimelapse of growing basil Desiccated basil showing seed dispersal Basil is an annual, or sometimes perennial, herb. Depending on the variety, plants can reach heights of between 30 and 150 centimetres (1 and 5 feet).[6] Basil leaves are glossy and ovulate, with smooth or slightly toothed edges that typically cup slightly; the leaves are arranged oppositely along the square stems.[7] Leaves may be green or purple. Its flowers are small and white, and grow from a central inflorescence, or spike, that emerges from the central stem atop the plant.[citation needed] Unusual among Lamiaceae, the four stamens and the pistil are not pushed under the upper lip of the corolla, but lie over the inferior lip. After entomophilous pollination, the corolla falls off and four round achenes develop inside the bilabiate calyx.[citation needed]\n##Phytochemistry\nThe various basils have such distinct scents because the volatile aromatic compounds vary with cultivars.[5] The essential oil from European basil contains high concentrations of linalool and methyl chavicol (estragole), in a ratio of about 3:1.[5][8] Other constituents include: 1,8-cineole, eugenol, and myrcene, among others.[5][9] The clove scent of sweet basil is derived from eugenol.[10] The aroma profile of basil includes 1,8-cineole[11][12] and methyl eugenol.[11][13] In this species eugenol is synthesised from coniferyl acetate and NADPH.[14]\n##Hybrids\nAfrican blue basil (Ocimum basilicum × O. kilimandscharicum) Lemon basil (Ocimum basilicum × O. americanum)[19][20] Spice basil (Ocimum basilicum × O. americanum), which is sometimes sold as holy basil\n##Etymology \n The name "basil" comes from the Latin basilius, and the Greek βασιλικόν φυτόν (basilikón phytón), meaning "royal/kingly plant", possibly because the plant was believed to have been used in production of royal perfumes.[21] Basil is likewise sometimes referred to in French as "l'herbe royale" ('the royal herb').[22] The Latin name has been confused with basilisk, as it was supposed to be an antidote to the basilisk's venom.[21]
